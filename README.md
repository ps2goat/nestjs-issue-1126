# nestjs-issue-1126
repo for reproduction of error in nestjs - errors in async provider are being swallowed.


## running
- `npm install`

using VS Code, I use the Launch button.

But you can run `npm build:watch` to build typescript to javascript (and monitor for changes), then `npm run start:watch`
